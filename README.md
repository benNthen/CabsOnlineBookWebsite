# ABOUT
This is a simple web-based application that simulates a taxi booking system, where the user can play the role of a passenger who wants to book a taxi service and an administrator that can view them and assign a taxi.

# HOW TO

On the application’s folder, there are two HTML files to choose from:

a. For Passengers: select ‘booking.html, then enter your name(full, first, or last), phone number, pick-up address and destination suburb. Then click ‘Book’ and wait for about 5 seconds as the program takes in your details. A counter will pop-up on the window’s screen while the app is loading, so click ‘Ok’. You will then get a ticket-message with your booking reference ID and an allocated time for the taxi to pick you up 25 minutes upon booking.

b. For Administrators: select ‘admin.html, then enter the booking reference number. To show all the booking requests made by the passengers that are currently unassigned click ‘Show Requests’ and to assign a taxi to a specific booking then select ‘Assign Taxi’.

# LIST OF FILES IN THE SYSTEM

The list of the following files stored in the assign2 directory are as follows:
-	HTML: index.html, booking.html, admin.html
-	PHP: form.php, searchrequest.php, assignrequest.php
-	Javascripts: dataajax.js, reqajax.js, objxhr.js
